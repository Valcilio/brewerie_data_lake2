
# Brewery Data Lake Project

## Introduction

This project was built to deploy an ETL along with a data lake structure on AWS that retrieves data from the public Open BreweryDB API (site: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

### What is Open Brewery DB

Open Brewery DB is a public API that provides information about breweries, including location, name, contact number, and brewery type.
These data can be retrieved via API requests following the documentation available on the website (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/). Below is the data catalog:

#### ðŸ“‘ Data Catalog â€” Open Brewery DB

| Field            | Data Type                   | Description                                                               |

## Features

This project includes several features to enable data retrieval from the API, transformation, and proper storage, as well as monitoring and error handling.
These functionalities are described in the sections below.

### Extraction, Transformation, and Load (+ AWS Parameter Store and EventBridge)

<p align="center">

</p>

The ETL process is triggered by an EventBridge rule that activates a Lambda function, which in turn creates an EC2 instance.
This EC2 pulls a Docker image from Amazon ECR to run the Python code in a containerized environment. This process includes:

- **Extraction**: 200 records are extracted from Open Brewery DB and a parameter is saved to Parameter Store, which helps indicate the next 200 records to fetch in the subsequent ETL run;
- **Transformation**: the same ETL is used to transform the data using Python code.
    - **Creation of the "brewery_location" column**: by concatenating the "country", "state_province", and "city" columns. This helps partition the data by brewery location in the silver layer.
    - **Data Structuring**: to efficiently store and query data, it is saved in the Parquet format, which is ideal for the silver layer.
    - **View Development**: to quickly access the number of breweries by type and location, an aggregated Parquet file was created and saved in the Gold Layer.
- **Load**: data is written to S3 buckets (one for each layer: bronze, silver, and gold). The write process uses KMS encryption to ensure client-side security.

### Medallion Architecture with Amazon S3 (+ Lifecycle and AWS KMS)

<p align="center">

</p>

This medallion architecture uses three different S3 buckets: one for each layer â€” bronze, silver, and gold. Each bucket has its own lifecycle rule.

- **Bronze Layer**: stores raw data. Lifecycle moves data to S3 Glacier after 30 days for cost reduction;
- **Silver Layer**: stores structured data. Lifecycle moves data to S3 Glacier after 90 days for cost efficiency;
- **Gold Layer**: stores data views. No lifecycle, as data needs to be available quickly.

### ETL Monitoring

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fwOdDL1.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="300">
</p>

CloudWatch monitors the ETL by tracking logs from both Lambda and EC2, giving real-time visibility into the ETL process.

## Data Access

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sgNtwqO.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="600">
</p>

To enable SQL access to the views, a Glue Crawler catalogs the data in the Gold Layer and places it into a Glue Database, allowing Athena to query the data.

### Error Handling (Alerts and Retries)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s6fyoko.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="600">
</p>

In case of an error, the ETL sends a message via SNS to subscribed user emails and retries up to 3 times. If all retries fail, another message is sent to inform responsible users.

## Project Architecture

This section explains the overall project architecture, divided into three parts: software, CI/CD, and cloud.

### Software Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eyycvqd.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="800">
</p>

A clean architecture was adopted. Each layer has similar responsibilities:

- **Artifacts**: contains artifacts for data validation;
- **Entities**: contains the main entity (brewery), validating the expected data types;
- **Use Cases**: contains use cases, such as code for data extraction, transformation, and loading;
- **Handlers**: connects external factors (AWS integration) to business rules from entities and use cases;
- **Utils**: generic yet useful code, such as log generation;
- **Main**: entry point that centralizes imports to launch the software;
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: located in the `tests` folder, built with Pytest.

For deeper understanding, check the docstrings in each function, method, class, and module.

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XY9rrdK.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="1200">
</p>

The CI/CD pipeline runs on GitHub Actions. It functions as shown, but requires configuration of some secrets (explained below).

### Cloud Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jiiDzKI.png" alt="Brewery ETL" width="1200">
</p>

This diagram shows the complete cloud architecture. Individual components were discussed earlier, and here they are shown fully connected.

Possible improvements:

- **Implement CloudWatch Alarms**: Could help detect EC2-related issues. Not implemented due to the low, fixed data volume, but could enhance reliability.
- **Implement Auto Scaling Policy**: Not necessary for this static data load, but could help if requirements grow.

## How to Deploy the Project

There is three common errors when deploying to be aware and avoid:

1. **ECR Build Error**: If an error occurs, rerun the pipeline. If it persists, wait for AWS to grant EC2 access;
2. **Lambda EC2 Creation Error**: AWS might block Lambda from creating an EC2. Wait for EC2 access to be unlocked;
3. **Bucket Creation Error**: If you forget to rename buckets, errors will occur. Follow the tutorial carefully.

Below follow the tutorial.

### Step 1: AWS Account Setup

#### Create AWS Account

Follow AWSâ€™s official guide: https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/

#### Create ADMIN IAM

It's recommended to create a user with admin access because of the high quantity of services needed by this project. If it's not possible just go giving the specific permissions.

#### Create S3 for Terraform State

Secrets to configure:

- `ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS Account ID;
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Key ID from your created admin iam user;
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: AWS default region to configure the resources;
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key from your created iam user;
- `SNS_EMAIL_SUBSCRIBED`: your e-mail which will receive the error messages.

#### Rename Buckets

2. brewery-silver-layer2  
3. brewery-gold-layer2  
4. brewery-athena-outputs2  
5. brewery-test-files-temp2
